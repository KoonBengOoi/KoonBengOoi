- 👋 Hi, I’m @KoonBengOoi
- 👀 I’m want to know the effect moving outdoor heat to the indoors during the cold months 
To meet the night comfort temperature of 15C, i have  a hydronic floor that is heated by a 50m deep vertical ground heat exchanger which has a bottom temperature of 17C.
- 🌱 I’m currently using EnergyPlus to check whether reflected solar radiation concentrated by a parabolic trough can heat the indoors to 20C during daytime.
- 💞️ I’m looking to use the thermal mass in the ground to buffer the few days when there is no sun.
- 📫 You can reach me at ooi_kb3@hotmail.com
